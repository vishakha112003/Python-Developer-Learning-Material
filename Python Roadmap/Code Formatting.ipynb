    "YAPF (Yet Another Python Formatter) is a Python code formatter created by Google. It reformats your Python code to make it more consistent and readable according to a set of formatting rules. The idea is that instead of spending time manually formatting your code, you let YAPF handle it for you, so you can focus on writing the code itself."

    "- Code Style: YAPF uses a configurable style guide (you can choose from PEP 8, Google's style guide, or define your own custom style).\n",
    "- Automatic Formatting: When you run YAPF, it automatically adjusts the spacing, indentation, line breaks, and other aspects of your code to match the chosen style guide.\n",
