    "- Greenlets: Think of greenlets like tiny workers that can handle tasks one by one very quickly. They’re much lighter than traditional threads, which are like heavier workers that take up more resources.\n",
    "- Monkey Patching: Gevent can \"change\" some Python modules (like networking and time functions) so they work better with its tiny workers, making everything run smoothly without getting stuck. Gevent can \"monkey-patch\" standard Python modules like socket, ssl, os, time, and others, allowing them to work cooperatively with greenlets. This means you can use these modules in a gevent-powered application as if they were blocking, but they will actually yield control when waiting for I/O.\n",
    "- Asynchronous I/O: When your program is waiting for something, like data from the internet, gevent lets it do other tasks in the meantime, so it's not just sitting idle."

    "Sanic is another web framework in Python, similar to Tornado, but with a focus on being fast and simple to use. It’s designed to help you build web applications quickly, especially ones that need to handle a lot of requests efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Ideas:\n",
    "- Speed: Sanic is known for being really fast. It was one of the first Python web frameworks built on asyncio, which allows it to handle multiple requests at the same time without slowing down.\n",
    "- Asynchronous: Like Tornado, Sanic uses asynchronous programming. This means it can start a task (like fetching data from a database) and while waiting for that task to finish, it can start another task. This makes your web application run faster and more efficiently.\n",
    "- Simple Routing: Sanic makes it easy to set up routes, which are the different URLs or pages on your website. For example, you can quickly create a route that shows a homepage, another for a user profile, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "- Request and Response: When someone visits your site, Sanic handles their request and sends back a response. For instance, if they visit your homepage, Sanic might send back \"Welcome to my website!\".\n",
    "- Blueprints: These are a way to organize your routes and views. If you have a big app with many features, blueprints help you keep everything organized.\n",
    "- Middleware: Sanic allows you to run certain code before or after handling a request. For example, you could use middleware to check if a user is logged in before allowing them to see certain pages."
